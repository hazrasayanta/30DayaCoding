### **Basic DOM Manipulation Questions**

1. What is the DOM, and how does JavaScript interact with it?
2. What are different ways to select elements in the DOM?
   * `getElementById`
   * `getElementsByClassName`
   * `getElementsByTagName`
   * `querySelector`
   * `querySelectorAll`
3. How do you change the text content of an element using JavaScript?
4. How do you modify the attributes of an element?
5. How do you create, append, and remove elements dynamically?
6. How do you handle events in JavaScript (inline vs. `addEventListener`)?
7. What is event delegation, and why is it useful?
8. What is the difference between `innerHTML`, `textContent`, and `innerText`?
9. How do you traverse the DOM (parent, children, siblings)?

### **Scenario-Based Questions**

1. **Modify a Specific Element**

   You have four `<p>` tags inside a `<div>` with the same class name. How would you change the text of the second `<p>` without modifying the HTML?
2. **Remove an Element**

   Given a button inside a `<div>`, how do you remove the button from the DOM when clicked?
3. **Change CSS Dynamically**

   How do you change the background color of a `<div>` when hovering over it using JavaScript (without CSS `:hover`)?
4. **Toggle Visibility**

   How do you show/hide a `<div>` when clicking a button?
5. **Dynamic List Handling**

   How do you add new list items (`<li>`) dynamically to an unordered list when clicking an "Add" button?
6. **Event Delegation Use Case**

   If you have a list (`<ul>`) and you want to handle clicks on dynamically added `<li>` elements, what approach should you take?
7. **Prevent Default Behavior**

   If you have a link (`<a>`), how do you prevent it from navigating to another page?
8. **Drag and Drop Functionality**

   How would you implement a basic drag-and-drop feature using the DOM?
9. **Form Handling**

   How do you validate a form input before submission and prevent form submission if the validation fails?
10. **Countdown Timer**

    How do you create a countdown timer that updates the UI every second?
