# **üìå Debugging & Logging in Node.js (Interview Guide)**

Debugging and logging are essential aspects of software development that help track errors, monitor performance, and understand the flow of your application. In Node.js, both built-in and third-party tools and techniques can be used for effective debugging and logging.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Debugging & Logging are Important in Node.js**

* **Error Tracking** : Helps in identifying where and why an error occurred.
* **Application Monitoring** : Gives insight into how the application is performing.
* **Debugging Flow** : Allows you to trace the flow of execution in asynchronous code.
* **Performance Optimization** : By logging key metrics, you can identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
* **Production Debugging** : Provides crucial insights in production environments without interrupting the service.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging Techniques in Node.js**

### **Step 1: Using `console.log()` for Basic Debugging**

The simplest way to debug a Node.js application is using `console.log()`. However, it is often insufficient for production environments.

```javascript
const addNumbers = (a, b) => {
  console.log(`Adding ${a} and ${b}`);
  return a + b;
};

console.log(addNumbers(5, 3));  // Output: Adding 5 and 3
```

**Limitations:**

* It can clutter the console.
* Not suitable for production environments.
* Doesn‚Äôt provide detailed stack traces for errors.

---

### **Step 2: Node.js Built-in Debugger**

Node.js comes with a built-in debugger that allows you to pause execution and inspect variables during runtime.

#### **How to Use:**

1. Run the application with the `inspect` flag:
   ```bash
   node --inspect app.js
   ```
2. Open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome browser and click "Inspect" to start debugging.
3. You can set breakpoints in your code and inspect variables in real-time.

 **Debugging with VSCode** : If you‚Äôre using VSCode, you can set breakpoints directly in the editor. In the `launch.json` file, specify the `node` process to attach to.

Example of `launch.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Step 3: Using `debug` Module**

The `debug` module is a third-party package that enables more advanced debugging, especially useful in larger applications.

#### **Installation** :

```bash
npm install debug
```

#### **Usage** :

```javascript
const debug = require('debug')('app:server');

debug('Server is running on port 3000');

app.listen(3000, () => {
  debug('Server started');
});
```

 **How it works** : To activate the debug logs, set the `DEBUG` environment variable.

```bash
DEBUG=app:* node app.js
```

You can enable different namespaces, allowing for granular control over logging output.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Logging in Node.js**

Effective logging provides visibility into application events, errors, and performance.

### **Step 1: Using `console.log()`**

Just like debugging, `console.log()` can also be used for logging events in development environments.

```javascript
console.log('Server started on port 3000');
```

However, in production environments, you need more advanced logging tools with capabilities like log rotation, persistent storage, and log levels.

---

### **Step 2: Using the `winston` Logging Library**

`winston` is a popular and versatile logging library for Node.js that supports multiple log levels, transports (console, file, database, etc.), and log rotation.

#### **Installation** :

```bash
npm install winston
```

#### **Basic Example** :

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console({ format: winston.format.simple() }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
  ]
});

logger.info('Application started');
logger.error('An error occurred');
```

#### **Log Levels** :

* `info`: Standard application events.
* `warn`: Warnings or potential issues.
* `error`: Errors that require attention.
* `debug`: Detailed debugging logs.

#### **Log Rotation** :

To prevent log files from growing too large, you can use the `winston-daily-rotate-file` transport.

```bash
npm install winston-daily-rotate-file
```

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');
require('winston-daily-rotate-file');

const transport = new winston.transports.DailyRotateFile({
  filename: 'logs/%DATE%-app.log',
  datePattern: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  maxFiles: '14d',
});

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  transports: [
    transport
  ]
});

logger.info('Application started');
```

### **Step 3: Using `morgan` for HTTP Logging**

`morgan` is a middleware that logs HTTP requests in your Node.js application.

#### **Installation** :

```bash
npm install morgan
```

#### **Usage** :

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');

const app = express();

app.use(morgan('combined'));  // Logs detailed request information

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

`morgan` can log HTTP requests in several formats, like `combined`, `dev`, `short`, or `tiny`.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Debugging & Logging Techniques**

### **Step 1: Monitoring with External Services**

For production environments, it's beneficial to integrate with external monitoring and logging services like:

* **Loggly** : Collects logs from Node.js apps and provides advanced querying and visualization.
* **Datadog** : Provides monitoring, log collection, and APM (Application Performance Monitoring).
* **Sentry** : Captures and tracks errors, providing detailed stack traces and context for debugging.

#### **Example with Sentry** :

```bash
npm install @sentry/node
```

```javascript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');
Sentry.init({ dsn: 'your-sentry-dsn' });

app.use(Sentry.Handlers.errorHandler());
```

This helps track production errors and allows for proactive debugging.

---

### **Step 2: Performance Profiling**

For performance debugging, you can use tools like **Node.js built-in profiler** or external services like **New Relic** or  **AppDynamics** . These tools can help identify slow functions, memory leaks, and CPU bottlenecks.

#### **Node.js Profiler Example** :

```bash
node --inspect app.js
```

Then, navigate to Chrome DevTools to inspect CPU profiles and memory usage.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices for Debugging & Logging**

* **Use log levels** : Implement multiple log levels (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`) to control verbosity.
* **Avoid logging sensitive information** : Do not log sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or credit card numbers.
* **Log context** : Provide relevant contextual information in logs (e.g., request IDs, user IDs) to make debugging easier.
* **Use centralized logging** : For production systems, centralize logs (e.g., through Loggly, Elasticsearch, or a custom solution) to easily analyze them.
* **Limit console.log() usage** : In production, rely on structured logging libraries like `winston` or `bunyan` rather than `console.log()`.
* **Rotate and archive logs** : Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes and prevent filling up disk space.
