# **📌 Unit Testing in Node.js (Interview Guide)**

## **1️⃣ Introduction to Unit Testing**

Unit testing ensures that individual units (functions or methods) of your application are working as expected. In Node.js, unit tests help ensure that your code is reliable and maintainable.

### **Benefits of Unit Testing:**

* **Catches bugs early**
* **Facilitates code refactoring**
* **Ensures code reliability**
* **Improves documentation**

# **2️⃣ Popular Testing Frameworks in Node.js**

There are several testing libraries and frameworks available for Node.js, but the most commonly used ones are:

### **🔹 Mocha**

* A flexible testing framework for Node.js, it provides a feature-rich testing environment.
* Supports asynchronous tests, and various assertion libraries, and is highly extensible.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
```

**Basic Example:**

```js
const assert = require('assert');

describe('Array', function() {
  it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
    assert.strictEqual([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
  });
});
```

### **🔹 Chai**

* A BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js, typically used with Mocha.
* It allows for expressive and readable assertions.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install chai --save-dev
```

**Basic Example:**

```js
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;

describe('Array', function() {
  it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
    expect([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4)).to.equal(-1);
  });
});
```

### **🔹 Jest**

* A testing framework developed by Facebook, designed to be simple and zero configuration.
* Built-in assertions, mocking, and spies, as well as easy asynchronous testing.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install jest --save-dev
```

**Basic Example:**

```js
test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
});
```

# **3️⃣ Writing Unit Tests in Node.js**

Unit tests focus on testing isolated units of code, like individual functions or methods, without relying on external systems (e.g., databases, APIs).

### **🔹 Structure of a Test**

A typical test consists of three parts:

* **Arrange** : Set up the necessary preconditions and inputs.
* **Act** : Call the function or method being tested.
* **Assert** : Verify that the results are correct.

**Example:**

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

describe('sum function', () => {
  it('should return the correct sum of two numbers', () => {
    // Arrange
    const num1 = 1;
    const num2 = 2;

    // Act
    const result = sum(num1, num2);

    // Assert
    expect(result).to.equal(3);
  });
});
```

# **4️⃣ Testing Asynchronous Code**

In Node.js, many functions are asynchronous, and writing unit tests for them requires handling promises or callback functions.

### **🔹 Example using Mocha & Chai (Async Test)**

```js
const fs = require('fs');

describe('File reading', () => {
  it('should read the file content', (done) => {
    fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) return done(err);
      expect(data).to.equal('Hello World');
      done();
    });
  });
});
```

### **🔹 Example using Jest (Async Test)**

```js
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return response.json();
};

test('fetches data from API', async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  expect(data).toHaveProperty('id');
});
```

# **5️⃣ Mocking and Stubbing in Unit Tests**

Mocking and stubbing help simulate external dependencies, like API calls or database queries, to isolate the code being tested.

### **🔹 Mocking with Jest**

Jest provides built-in mocking capabilities.

**Example of Mocking a Function:**

```js
const myFunction = jest.fn();

myFunction.mockReturnValue('Hello World');

test('mock function', () => {
  expect(myFunction()).toBe('Hello World');
});
```

### **🔹 Stubbing with Sinon**

Sinon is another popular library for stubbing and spying.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install sinon --save-dev
```

**Example of Stubbing a Method:**

```js
const sinon = require('sinon');
const myObject = { greet: () => 'Hello' };

const stub = sinon.stub(myObject, 'greet').returns('Hi');

console.log(myObject.greet());  // 'Hi'
```

# **6️⃣ Test Coverage**

Test coverage measures how much of your code is covered by tests. High test coverage generally leads to fewer bugs and more confidence in your code.

### **🔹 Using `nyc` for Code Coverage**

`nyc` is a command-line tool used to collect coverage information for Node.js applications.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install nyc --save-dev
```

**Basic Command:**

```bash
nyc mocha
```

### **🔹 Viewing Coverage Report**

After running tests with `nyc`, a coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` folder.

# **7️⃣ Best Practices for Unit Testing in Node.js**

* **Test small units** : Focus on testing individual functions, not entire modules or components.
* **Keep tests isolated** : Ensure tests are independent of each other and do not affect the global state.
* **Use descriptive names** : Write clear and concise test names to describe the behavior being tested.
* **Mock external dependencies** : Avoid relying on real external services (e.g., databases, APIs) in your tests by mocking them.
* **Run tests frequently** : Use tools like **Nodemon** or **Jest** to automatically run tests whenever the code changes.
* **Aim for high code coverage** : Strive to test as much of your code as possible, but focus on testing the most critical paths first.
