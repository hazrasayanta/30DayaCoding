# **Intermediate Redux Questions with Answers & Diagrams**

## **16. What is the role of middleware in Redux?**

### **Answer:**

Middleware in Redux **extends the store’s capabilities** by intercepting actions before they reach the reducer. It is used for:

* Logging actions (`redux-logger`).
* Handling **asynchronous** API calls (`redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`).
* Performing side effects (e.g., analytics, authentication).

### **Example of Middleware:**

```javascript
const loggerMiddleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  console.log("Dispatching:", action);
  return next(action);
};
```

## **17. Explain the difference between redux-thunk and redux-saga.**

| Feature              | Redux Thunk                    | Redux Saga                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**       | Middleware                     | Middleware                                     |
| **Purpose**    | Handles async logic in actions | Uses sagas (generators) to manage side effects |
| **Complexity** | Simple                         | More complex                                   |
| **Control**    | Action-based                   | Saga-based (event-driven)                      |

## **18. What is Redux Thunk, and why is it used?**

### **Answer:**

Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows action creators to  **return functions instead of plain objects** . This enables **async API calls** inside action creators.

### **Example:**

```javascript
export const fetchData = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    const data = await fetch("/api/data").then((res) => res.json());
    dispatch({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: data });
  };
};
```

---

## **19. How do you perform asynchronous actions in Redux?**

### **Answer:**

Redux does not support async actions  **natively** . Instead, we use:

* **Redux Thunk**
* **Redux Saga**
* **Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk**

---

## **20. What are pure reducers, and why must reducers be pure functions?**

### **Answer:**

A  **pure function** :

1. **Has no side effects** (does not modify external variables).
2. **Always returns the same output for the same input** .

Reducers **must be pure** to:

* Ensure  **predictability** .
* Enable  **time-travel debugging** .
* Improve performance with memoization.

### **Impure Reducer (Wrong)**

```javascript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  state.count++;  // ❌ Mutates state
  return state;
};
```

### **Pure Reducer (Correct)**

```javascript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };  // ✅ Immutable update
};
```

---

## **21. Can we modify the Redux store directly? Why or why not?**

### **Answer:**

❌ **No, we cannot modify the store directly.**

Redux follows  **immutability** , meaning we **must dispatch actions** instead of modifying state.

---

## **22. What is the purpose of the combineReducers function?**

### **Answer:**

The `combineReducers()` function **combines multiple reducers** into a  **single reducer function** .

### **Example:**

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  posts: postReducer,
});
```

### **Reducer Combination Flow**

```
combineReducers({ user, posts }) -> rootReducer
```

---

## **23. What are selectors in Redux, and why are they used?**

### **Answer:**

Selectors are functions that **extract specific pieces of state** from the store.

### **Example:**

```javascript
const selectUser = (state) => state.user;
```

### **Why use selectors?**

* Improves  **code reusability** .
* Enhances **performance** with memoization.

---

## **24. What is reselect, and how does it improve Redux performance?**

### **Answer:**

`reselect` is a library that **memoizes selectors** to prevent unnecessary computations.

### **Example with Reselect:**

```javascript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const selectUsers = (state) => state.users;
const selectActiveUsers = createSelector([selectUsers], (users) =>
  users.filter((user) => user.active)
);
```

✅ **Improves performance** by recalculating  **only when necessary** .

---

## **25. How can you persist the Redux store in a React app?**

### **Answer:**

To **persist Redux state** after page reloads, use:

* `redux-persist`
* `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`

### **Example using redux-persist:**

```javascript
import { persistStore, persistReducer } from "redux-persist";
import storage from "redux-persist/lib/storage";

const persistConfig = { key: "root", storage };
const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);

const store = createStore(persistedReducer);
const persistor = persistStore(store);
```

---

## **26. What are the advantages of using Redux Toolkit (RTK)?**

✅ **Less Boilerplate**

✅ **Built-in Middleware (Thunk, Immer)**

✅ **Performance Optimizations**

✅ **Simplified Async Handling (createAsyncThunk)**

---

## **27. What is Immer.js, and how does Redux Toolkit use it?**

### **Answer:**

**Immer.js** simplifies **immutable state updates** in Redux Toolkit.

### **Example (Without Immer)**

```javascript
const newState = { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
```

### **Example (With Immer)**

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.count += 1; },  // ✅ Mutates, but Immer handles immutability
  },
});
```

---

## **28. Explain how createSlice in Redux Toolkit simplifies state management.**

### **Answer:**

✅ **Combines actions and reducers** in a single function.

✅  **Automatically generates action types** .

✅  **Uses Immer.js for immutable updates** .

### **Example:**

```javascript
const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.count += 1; },
    decrement: (state) => { state.count -= 1; },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

---

## **29. What is the difference between a slice reducer and a traditional reducer?**

| Feature                | Traditional Reducer | Slice Reducer (RTK) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Boilerplate**  | More setup needed   | Less setup needed   |
| **Action Types** | Defined separately  | Auto-generated      |
| **Immutability** | Manually handled    | Uses Immer.js       |

---

## **30. How do you handle errors in Redux actions?**

### **Answer:**

Errors can be handled using:

* **Try-Catch Blocks**
* **Redux Middleware**
* **Error Reducers**
* **createAsyncThunk in RTK**

### **Example (Error Handling in Async Thunk)**

```javascript
import { createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const fetchUser = createAsyncThunk(
  "user/fetchUser",
  async (userId, { rejectWithValue }) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch");
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      return rejectWithValue(error.message);
    }
  }
);
```
