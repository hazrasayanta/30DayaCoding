# **13. Redux (State Management - Alternative to Context API) - Interview Revision Guide** 🚀

## **1. What is Redux?**

✔ **Redux** is a **state management library** for managing and sharing application state globally.

✔ It is used to handle complex application states in a **predictable** manner.

✔ Redux follows a **unidirectional data flow** and **centralizes** state in a single store.

---

## **2. When to Use Redux?**

✅ When the application has  **global state shared across many components** .

✅ When  **state management with Context API becomes complex** .

✅ When debugging and **time-travel debugging** are required (Redux DevTools).

✅ When **actions and reducers need to handle complex updates** (e.g., async API calls).

## **3. Core Principles of Redux**

| **Principle**                            | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Single Source of Truth**               | The entire application state is stored in a single object (store). |
| **State is Read-Only**                   | State can only be changed by dispatching actions.                  |
| **Changes are Made with Pure Functions** | Reducers specify how the state updates in an immutable way.        |

## **4. Redux Data Flow Diagram**

🔹 The **Redux flow** follows a  **unidirectional data flow** :

1️⃣ **Component** → Dispatches an  **action** .

2️⃣ **Action** → Describes what should change.

3️⃣ **Reducer** → Updates state based on action.

4️⃣ **Store** → Holds the global state.

5️⃣ **Component** → Subscribes to store changes.

## **5. Setting Up Redux in a React App**

🔹 Install Redux and React-Redux:

```sh
npm install redux react-redux
```

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Create the Redux Store** (`store.js`)

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";
import counterReducer from "./counterReducer";

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;
```

✔ `createStore()` creates the  **central store** .

✔ `counterReducer` is a function that defines how state updates.

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Define the Reducer** (`counterReducer.js`)

```js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT":
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case "DECREMENT":
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

export default counterReducer;
```

✔ **Reducer is a pure function** that takes `state` and `action` and returns a  **new state** .

✔ `switch` handles different action types.

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Provide Store to the App** (`index.js`)

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

✔ `Provider` makes the **Redux store** available to all components.

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Dispatch Actions from Components** (`Counter.js`)

```js
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";

function Counter() {
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.count);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

✔ `useSelector(state => state.count)` gets the count value from Redux state.

✔ `useDispatch()` allows dispatching actions to update state.

---

## **6. Handling Async API Calls with Redux Middleware (Redux Thunk)**

🔹 Install Redux Thunk:

```sh
npm install redux-thunk
```

🔹 Modify `store.js` to use  **thunk middleware** :

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";
import counterReducer from "./counterReducer";

const store = createStore(counterReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));

export default store;
```

🔹 Create an **async action** to fetch data:

```js
export const fetchData = () => {
    return async (dispatch) => {
        const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
        const data = await response.json();
        dispatch({ type: "SET_DATA", payload: data });
    };
};
```

## **7. Redux vs Context API - Key Differences**

| Feature       | Redux                                    | Context API                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Use Case      | Complex global state                     | Simple global state              |
| Setup         | Requires actions, reducers               | Minimal setup                    |
| Performance   | Optimized for large apps                 | Can cause unnecessary re-renders |
| Middleware    | Supports middleware (e.g., Thunk)        | No built-in middleware support   |
| Async Support | Handles async calls with `redux-thunk` | Needs manual async handling      |

| What are the core principles of Redux?                | Single source of truth, state is read-only, changes happen via pure functions.                                     |
| What is an action in Redux?                           | A plain JavaScript object that describes a state change.                                                           |
| What is a reducer?                                    | A pure function that takes current state and action, then returns a new state.                                     |
| What is the role of the store in Redux?               | It holds the global state and allows components to access it.                                                      |
| How do you update state in Redux?                     | By dispatching an action, which is processed by a reducer.                                                         |
| What is the difference between Redux and Context API? | Redux is better for complex state management with middleware support, Context API is simpler and built into React. |

## **9. Best Practices for Using Redux** ✅

✔ **Use Redux only when necessary** – avoid overuse for small projects.

✔ **Keep reducers pure** – do not modify state directly.

✔ **Use Redux DevTools** for debugging state changes.

✔ **Normalize state** to avoid deeply nested structures.

✔ **Use middleware** like Redux Thunk for handling async operations.

✔ **Structure Redux files properly** (actions, reducers, store).
