Here’s a list of practice questions and suggestions for each of the five important algorithmic techniques you mentioned:

---

### **🔁 Two Pointers**

Two pointers are commonly used for problems where you need to compare elements from both ends of a collection or when you need to iterate through the collection in two different ways.

---

#### **Suggestions:**

1. **Find if a pair with a given sum exists in a sorted array.**
2. **Reverse an array in place.**
3. **Find the middle element of a linked list.**
4. **Remove duplicates from a sorted array.**
5. **Check if a string is a palindrome.**
6. **Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.**
7. **Find the longest subarray with a given sum (subarray sum problem).**

---

### **💨 Sliding Window**

Sliding Window is an efficient technique for solving problems that involve finding a subarray of a given size or fulfilling a condition as the window slides through the array or string.

---

#### **Suggestions:**

1. **Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size K.**
2. **Longest substring with at most two distinct characters.**
3. **Find the minimum window in a string containing all characters of another string.**
4. **Longest substring without repeating characters.**
5. **Check if a given array has a subarray with a sum equal to K.**
6. **Find all anagrams of a string in another string.**
7. **Count the number of substrings with at least K distinct characters.**

---

### **🔁 Recursion**

Recursion is an elegant and powerful technique where a function calls itself to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.

---

#### **Suggestions:**

1. **Find the factorial of a number.**
2. **Generate all subsets of a given set (Power Set).**
3. **Solve the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.**
4. **Find the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.**
5. **Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.**
6. **Find the sum of digits of a number.**
7. **Reverse a string using recursion.**
8. **Solve problems like Merge Sort and Quick Sort using recursion.**

---

### **🧑‍🏫 Divide and Conquer**

Divide and conquer breaks a problem into smaller, more manageable parts, solves them independently, and combines the results.

---

#### **Suggestions:**

1. **Merge Sort** – Sort an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half, and merging the results.
2. **Quick Sort** – Sort an array by choosing a pivot, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the subarrays.
3. **Binary Search** – Find an element in a sorted array using the divide-and-conquer approach.
4. **Closest Pair of Points** – Find the closest pair of points in a 2D plane.
5. **Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)** – Divide the array into subarrays to find the maximum sum subarray.
6. **Count Inversions in an Array** – Using Merge Sort, find the number of inversions (out-of-order pairs) in an array.

---

### **🔍 Binary Search**

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array or determining if it exists. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

---

#### **Suggestions:**

1. **Find the position of a target element in a sorted array.**
2. **Find the square root of a number.**
3. **Find the first occurrence of an element in a sorted array.**
4. **Find the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.**
5. **Search for a target in a rotated sorted array.**
6. **Find the peak element in an array (an element that is greater than its neighbors).**
7. **Find the smallest element in a rotated sorted array.**

---

### **To Practice:**

For each of the above techniques, I suggest you try solving at least **3-5 problems** in each category, starting with easy ones and gradually increasing the difficulty. These techniques are fundamental for many coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.
